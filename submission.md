# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

Hello, I really enjoyed the exercise.

I have learned a ton through this experience. Found some really good online resources and had quite a lot of of Aha moments. This was a bit challenging for me as unfortunatelly I have not had a lot of experience on daily basis working with API's - I gete xcited whenever I get a chance to work with some real live data and see things coming through the page.

I enjoyed the use of tools we already use such as a code editor, github and npm.

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I think I would have try to manipulate local json data and maybe even used a framework, pulling external data was given me issues with asyncronous and loading times( I would do this to save time but I am happy I connected an external API) - good learning experience.

I would use a framework but I am better versed with vue.js and since Hubspot used different stacks I decided to do vanilla JS, I believe this can be used with any framework.

I wished I fixed the select by genre and enhanced the select by year feature where multiples categories would display on page.

I tried to implement join.(", ") on the genre array but was involving all of my elements.

I would have fixed the CSS on the exercise 1 better so that it was a bit more centered on the page.

I would have DRY my code a bit more.

I would have written tests for some of the features.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

Mostly with a bit of the design with the amount of html tags. Some were added dynamically others added directly into html

I used 'LESS' as opposed to 'SASS, mostly because this is the CSS tool I have used the longest and feel most comfortable but very much similar to 'SASS'.

I also added a dynamic hint to what is searchable on the search bar by adding a placeholder

I added the most recent year dates to the top of the list - I believe that users when it comes to movies and books like to check the latest trends first.

I added focus to allow user to use tab to go through links on the page.

I have added a bit of accessibility by adding roles to html tags that were not too explicit and adding alt tags to images.

I also fixed a broken link on the poster IMG array.

I did not use bootstrap but I used flexbox and also grid which mkaes things a bit easier and quicker to manage.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I just want to thank you for this opportunity and all the valuable lessons I've learned through this exercise and my interactions with everyone in the company so far.
